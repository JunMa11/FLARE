# Official repository of MICCAI 2021 Challenge: [FLARE21](https://flare.grand-challenge.org/FLARE21/).

We provide the evaluation code and a [video demo](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1mU4y1n7V6) of the evaluation process. You can use the code to evaluate the `Running time` and `Maximum used GPU memory` of your Docker.

Please feel free to raise any issues if you have questions about the challenge, e.g., dataset, evaluation measures, ranking scheme and so on.
